		<h1>Dr. Bones Profile</h1>
		<img src="../assets/Dr_bones.png" alt="Dr bones" width="500" height="500">
		<p>Hello I am the well renoun Dr. Emmanuel J. Bones and I work at Tutela's Children's Hospital. I am the head orthodontist in the dentistry sector. I have earned a Bachelor Degree in Dental Surgery and received a Masters Degree in Craniofacial Biology. I have labored in orthodontia services for 30 years in TC Hospital and yes I am the only skeleton doctor who works here. My workplace has the sounds of sharp buzzing from dental drills, hissing from tanks of nitrous oxide, and the suching noises coming from the aspirators. And sure there is the occasional crying child but I personally makes sure that every child feels safe under any procedures. How I may walk may at first seem clumsy and unpredictable, but it has a certain grace to it. One the other hand, the way I move with my hands are calm, steady, and very calculated. They never shake and they're very precise when when handling children's mouths. And let me tell you, I especially loves using puns and jokes to defuse any stress, I even been awarded the nickname of Dr. "Enamel" J. Bones. I also doesn't need to eat, sleep, or go to the restroom making me a permanent employee at TC Hospital. I'll quote myself time and time again, "My real super power is being a Doctor who can work without breaks."</p>
